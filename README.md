# Lit Asteroid
Lit asteroid is my implementation of the classic arcade game asteroids. This version is made using Unity Engine. This project can also be found, run and downloaded on https://sickandsleazy.itch.io/asteroid

## Controls & Constraints:

- The player can move and point the mouse to where they want the ship to shoot. So essentially, it's a clicker or a point and shoot game.

- Press left click to shoot a short bullet. Press and hold for 0.5 s to shoot a long bullet.

- Cooldown for short bullet is 0.25 s. There is no cooldown for long bullet.
